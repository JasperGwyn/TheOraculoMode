**User Journey: "The Oráculo's Whimsical Showdown"**

**Phase 1: Entry and Theme Introduction**

1. **Accessing the Platform:**
    * The user lands on the game's website.
    * They see a vibrant, animated interface featuring a whimsical character known as "The Oráculo."
2. **Encountering the Current Round's Question and Oráculo's Personality:**
    * A hilarious Yes/No question is presented: \
     * "Should AI assistants only communicate in pirate speak on International Talk Like a Pirate Day?" \
    * Alongside the question, the current personality of The Oráculo is announced. For example: \
*"The Oráculo is feeling 'Sarcastic' today, and appreciates witty, ironic answers."*

**Phase 2: Team Assigment and Betting**
3. **Choosing to participate:**
* The user decides to join the round and clicks "Participate."
* The Oráculo assigns the user to a team based on their preferences or randomly:
	* Team YES (advocating for AI pirate speak)
	* Team NO (arguing against this proposal)

4. **Placing the Bet (On-Chain):**
    * The user connects their wallet (via Crossmint, integrated with Mode).
    * They place a token bet into a shared prize pool that will be split among the winning team members.

**Phase 3: Crafting the Message**
5. **Creating a Single Persuasive Message (Off-Chain):**

* The user now sees a simple text box to submit their best, single message.
* They know The Oráculo values sarcastic wit this round. So, if they chose "Team YES," they might write: \
*"Absolutely! Nothing eases the pain of a null pointer exception like 'Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays!'"*
* For "Team NO," a user might say: \
*"Great idea... if you want developers to rage-quit faster than a JavaScript promise rejection!"*
* The user clicks "Submit" and is done. They don't need to stay around; the message is recorded off-chain.
1. **Waiting for the Round to End:**
    * The round runs for a predetermined time (e.g., a couple of hours).
    * Other players come, choose sides, place bets, and submit their messages.

**Phase 4: The Oráculo's Judgment**
7. **Closing the Round:**

* When time is up, no more entries are accepted.
* The backend fetches all messages from both teams.
1. **AI Evaluation (Off-Chain):**
    * The Oráculo (an AI agent) reviews the collected messages from both sides.
    * It evaluates them based on the declared personality criteria (e.g., sarcasm and irony).
    * Using this assessment, The Oráculo determines which team's collective set of messages best matches its humor and preferences.
    * The Oráculo returns a decision: "Team YES" or "Team NO."

**Phase 5: Outcome and Rewards**
9. **On-Chain Result Announcement:**

* Once the Oráculo's decision is obtained, the backend updates the smart contract on Mode with the winning team.
1. **Prize Distribution:**
    * The smart contract automatically divides the prize pool among the winning team's participants, proportional to their initial bets.
    * Each winning player can automatically receives their reward (tokens) or claims it by visiting the app again.

**Phase 6: Replay and Engagement**
12. **Viewing Results and Leaderboards:**
- The user returns to the site at their convenience to see the final outcome, their rewards, and any leaderboards or stats.
- Encouraged by their prize and the fun scenario, they might stay for the next round, where a new absurd prompt and a new personality for The Oráculo await, keeping the game fresh and entertaining.
